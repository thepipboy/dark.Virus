**Concept**: "The Shadowmatter Plague"  
- **Origin**: A lab accident merges dark matter particles with a prion-like nanomachine.  
- "Transmission": Not biological—infected hosts emit quantum-entangled dark particles that "phase-infect" neural tissue via gravitational tunneling.  
- **Symptoms**:  
  • Time-dilation perception (relativity effects)  
  • Spontaneous crystallization of tissue (mimicking dark matter structure)  
- **Containment**:  
  • Magnetic isolation fields  
  • Cure: Neutrino beams to disrupt particle entanglement
